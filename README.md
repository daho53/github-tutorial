Absolutely, here is the complete step-by-step guide including Git installation on Windows:

## 1. Installing Git on Windows

1. Download the latest Git for Windows installer from the following URL: https://git-scm.com/download/win

2. Once you've downloaded the installer, double-click it to start the installation.

3. During the installation, you can leave the default options checked, or customize them according to your needs.

4. Click "Install" to finish the installation process.

## 2. Create a New GitHub Account

1. Visit the GitHub homepage at https://github.com/
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button which can be found at the top right corner of the page.
3. On the next page, create a unique username, enter your email address, and create a strong password.
4. Complete the challenge to prove that you're a human, read and accept the terms, then click the "Create an account" button.
5. You will receive a verification email from GitHub. Click the link in the email to verify your account.

## 3. Generate an SSH Key

1. Open the Git Bash terminal in your local machine (installed with Git).
2. Generate a new SSH key by typing the following command, replacing 'your_email@example.com' with the email address you used to register your GitHub account:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Note: If you're using a legacy system that doesn't support the `ed25519` algorithm, use `rsa` instead:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. Press `Enter` to accept the default file location to save the key.
4. Enter a passphrase for this SSH key. You can also press `Enter` to proceed without a passphrase.
5. Your SSH key will be generated.

## 4. Add Your SSH Key to the SSH-Agent

1. Ensure that the ssh-agent is running by typing the following command:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent by typing the following command (if you used the default location when you created your key):

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Or, if you used `rsa`:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## 5. Add Your SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

1. To copy your SSH key to your clipboard, you can install 'clip' utility on Git Bash and type:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

Or, if you used `rsa`:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```

2. Go to GitHub, and click your profile photo, then click 'Settings'.
3. In the user settings sidebar, click 'SSH and GPG keys'.
4. Click 'New SSH key'.
5. In the 'Title' field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, "Work Laptop".
6. Paste your key into the 'Key' field.
7. Click 'Add SSH key'.
8. If prompted, confirm your password.

## 6. Create a New Repository

1. In the upper right corner, click the '+' icon, then select 'New repository'.
2. Name your repository.
3. Choose to make the repository either public or private.
4. Click 'Create repository'.

## 7. Push Your Project to the New Repository

1. Navigate to your project's local directory from your Git Bash terminal.
2. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository:

```bash
git init


```

3. Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit:

```bash
git add .
```

4. Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository:

```bash
git commit -m "First commit"
```

5. Copy the SSH url of your new GitHub repository. It should look something like this: `git@github.com:username/repository.git`.

6. In the terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:

```bash
git remote add origin remote_repository_URL
```

7. Verify your URL:

```bash
git remote -v
```

8. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

And that's it! You've successfully installed Git on Windows, created a GitHub account, set up SSH, and pushed your new project to GitHub.
